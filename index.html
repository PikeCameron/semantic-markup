            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>Many people know me as the star guard of the Utah Jazz. What people don't
                know is my strong passion for photography. I started last week when I saw 
                the most beautiful picture.
            </p>
            <p>Despite what I may be doing, one thing is always true: <em>Determination Over Negativity.</em></p>

            <h2>Why Go With Me?</h2>
            <p>Have you ever had your pictures taken by an NBA player? Especially one as attractive as me?
                Didn't think so. With every booked session with me, you will receive a free pair of signed 
                DON ISSUE #3 shoes. Now that's a deal!
            </p>

    <h2>What to Expect at Each Photoshoot</h2>

    <p>I know it may be different shooting with someone as awesome as me so let me break it down for you.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I am taking pictures of you, you are not taking pictures of me. Got it? Great.</li>
        <li>According to my signed deal with Adidas, you will have to be wearing some kind of Adidas gear
            in each shot.
        </li>
        <li>I am a huge fan of self-control so the following behaviors are unacceptable:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kissing</strong> of my feet</li>
                <li><em>Stealing</em> of my clothes</li>
                <li>If we are at your wedding, <em>remember,</em> you love your significant other, <strong>not</strong> me.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If I am shooting at your wedding, all three of us will cut the cake together.</li>
    </ol>
